# Introduction

`@ngx-flagr/routing` provides utilities to manage routing concerns within the context of feature flags by taking advantage of `@ngx-flagr/core`.

## Overview

Here are the main parts of `@ngx-flagr/routing` that can help you manage the routing concerns of your app using
feature flags:

- [Guards](./guards) to prevent access to specific routes
- [Preloading Strategies](./preloading-strategies) to speed up the loading
  of the lazily-loaded parts of your application

Make sure to check out the documentation for each part to learn more about their
usage and configuration.
