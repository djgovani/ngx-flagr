# Getting Started

To get started with `ngx-flagr`, the first package you will need is
`@ngx-flagr/core`. This package contains the core functionality of the library,
including feature flag evaluation and management.

## Installation

To get started with `ngx-flagr`, the root package that you will need is the
`@ngx-flagr/core`, containing the core of the library.

You may further extand the behavior of the library by adding other packages on
the top of it for various purpose, such as integrations with your feature flags
provider.

<Tabs defaultValue="npm" values={[
  {label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
  {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
]}>

  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @ngx-flagr/core
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @ngx-flagr/core
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add @ngx-flagr/core
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

Once the library is installed all what's left is for us to configure it.

### Providing a default `FeatureFlagService`

For the feature flags evaluation, `ngx-flagr` based itself on a service
dedicated to their evaluation.

In order for the library to work, we will need to provide an implementation for
it:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

import { FeatureFlagService } from '@ngx-flagr/core'

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class CustomFeatureFlagService implements FeatureFlagService {
  // ...
}
```

The `FeatureFlagService` interface requires us to implement a single `isEnabled`
method for the feature flags evaluation.

This method takes a feature flag and returns a value indicating whether or not
this feature flag is enabled.

A `FeatureFlag` is defined as:

```ts
type FeatureFlag = string | string[];
```

### Wiring everything up

// TODO

## Extending the library

`@ngx-flagr/core` provides the basic functionality for evaluating and managing
feature flags in your application. However, you may want to extend the library
to integrate with your specific feature flag provider or add additional
functionality.

To do this, you can install and use one of the available integration packages or
add-on packages provided by the ngx-flagr library. Check out the documentation
of the relevant packages for more information on how to use them.
