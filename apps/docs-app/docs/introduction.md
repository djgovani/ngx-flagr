> ðŸš© Effortless feature flag management in Angular

`ngx-flagr` is a library built to support feature flags management. It provides
a set of Angular classes that you can use to easily and efficiently manage
feature flags.

With `ngx-flagr`, you can easily manage feature flags, target specific users or
segments, and experiment with different variations of your app's features.

This library is [on GitHub](https://github.com/pbouillon/ngx-flagr) and under
the [MIT licence](https://github.com/pBouillon/ngx-flagr/blob/main/LICENSE). You
can also freely check the [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/ngx-flagr)
published for it.
